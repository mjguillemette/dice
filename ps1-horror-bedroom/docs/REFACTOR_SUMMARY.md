# Architecture Refactor Summary
**PS1 Horror Dice Game - Code Cleanup & Scalability Improvements**

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)

#### 1. **Comprehensive Architecture Audit**
- Analyzed entire codebase structure
- Identified 7 major systems and their dependencies
- Documented coupling issues and anti-patterns
- Created detailed metrics and assessment
- **Document**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md`

**Key Findings**:
- App.tsx is a "God Object" (~500 lines, managing 5+ systems)
- DiceManager.tsx has too many responsibilities (~800 lines)
- State split across 4+ different management patterns
- High coupling between UI and business logic
- Circular dependencies between systems

---

#### 2. **Modular Architecture Design**
- Designed new 4-layer architecture (Data → Logic → State → Presentation)
- Created detailed folder structure proposal
- Defined clear system boundaries and interfaces
- Planned event-driven communication pattern
- **Document**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REDESIGN.md`

**New Structure**:
```
src/
├── core/              # Pure business logic (no React)
│   ├── models/       # Data models
│   ├── systems/      # Game systems
│   └── services/     # Cross-cutting concerns
├── state/            # Zustand store
├── presentation/     # React components
```

---

#### 3. **Unified Data Models** ✨ NEW CODE

Created type-safe, domain-driven models for all major entities:

**`src/core/models/Dice.model.ts`**
- `DiceModel` - Core dice entity
- `DiceModifier` - Modifiers applied to dice
- `DiceTransformation` - Dice transformations
- `DiceRollResult` - Roll results
- `DicePool` - Player's dice collection
- Factory functions and type guards

**`src/core/models/Item.model.ts`**
- `ItemModel` - Core item entity
- `ItemEffect` - Effect system
- `EffectContext` - Effect application context
- `InventoryModel` - Player inventory
- `StoreModel` - Shop/store state
- Utility functions for item management

**`src/core/models/Score.model.ts`**
- `ScoreModel` - Score achievement
- `TimeOfDayScores` - Scores per time period
- `ScoringModel` - Complete scoring state
- `ScoreMultiplier` - Score modifiers
- Helper functions for combo calculations

**`src/core/models/GameState.model.ts`**
- `GameStateModel` - Core game state
- `GameConfig` - Game configuration
- `SaveData` - Persistence structure
- Utility functions for game flow

All models include:
- ✅ Strict TypeScript types
- ✅ Factory functions
- ✅ Type guards
- ✅ Utility helpers
- ✅ JSDoc documentation

---

#### 4. **Event Bus System** ✨ NEW CODE

**`src/core/services/EventBus.ts`**

Implemented centralized event system for decoupled communication:

**Features**:
- ✅ Type-safe event types (40+ game events defined)
- ✅ Subscribe/unsubscribe pattern
- ✅ Once listeners (auto-unsubscribe)
- ✅ Event history tracking
- ✅ Debug mode
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Promise-based event waiting

**API**:
```typescript
// Subscribe
eventBus.on('dice:settled', (event) => {
  console.log(event.payload);
});

// Emit
eventBus.emit('score:calculated', { scores, total: 150 });

// Subscribe once
eventBus.once('game:ended', (event) => saveGame());
```

**Event Types**:
- Dice events (spawned, rolled, settled, transformed)
- Score events (calculated, achieved, combo)
- Item events (purchased, activated, expired)
- Game state events (started, paused, phase_changed)
- Progression events (time:advanced, day:started)
- Economy events (currency:earned, store:opened)
- Corruption events (increased, threshold_reached)
